--The most popular product_ID by quantity is 712 and its name is "AWC Logo Cap" with 8311 units sold
--which brought $51,229 gross revenue to the company. Although it has the highest sales volume, it has a relatively 
--lower unit price, which generated less than 30% of revenue of other products, such as 
--Long-Sleeve Logo Jersey (~$200k) and Sport-100 Helmet (~$165k).
